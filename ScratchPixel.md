## Right-Handed cordinate system

If we take the bottom left corner of our screen as our origin coordinate system XY (0,0) we can choose to create a Z axis perpendiculare to XY plane in both direction forward or backward the screen plan.

The **Left-Handed** and **Right-Handed** it's just here to remberer in which convention we place our object.

*X,Y,Z* are respectively *thumb,index and middle finger*, the **thumb** must always point to **right**. In this configuration we can see that our **left hand** have a middle finger which points **forward** and with the **right hand** **backward**.
